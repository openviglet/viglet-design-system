# Authoring a bento page

The rules that keep every bento screen looking like the same product. They held
across a hundred-odd pages in one console because one team read one file; this
is that file, addressed to anyone importing
`@viglet/viglet-design-system/bento`.

The first mistake is a page that looks bento inside a console that does not.
Adopt the shell before the pages.

## 1. Structure — thin config, not bespoke pages

There are three page shapes. Almost every screen is one of them plus data.

**A detail screen** is `BentoEntityShell` wrapping a form. The shell owns the
identity hero, the save-bar morph and the delete flow; the form is a render prop
receiving `{ staged, onStateChange }` and groups its fields in
`BentoFormSection`s. Wire the query hooks in the page and put no shell mechanics
there.

**A list screen** is one `BentoListPage` call with a `renderTile`. Use
`BentoEntityTile` for the common icon-chip + status-pill + title + meta shape;
hand-roll a tile only when the entity genuinely needs a different layout.

**A form screen with its own hero** is `BentoFormHero` as the first child inside
the `<form>` it submits. It renders both halves of the morph itself.

**A frosted box with arbitrary content** — a stats strip, a toolbar, a listing,
a message — is `BentoPanel`. It is the one container in this layer with **no
heading**, which is the point rather than an omission: those surfaces sit under a
hero that already names the page, and a heading on them is noise that also puts a
section in the document outline the page does not have. Two class slots,
`className` on the frosted container and `contentClassName` on the inner wrapper,
and no padding of its own — a table wants `p-0` and a toolbar wants `py-2`.
Never hand-roll `bento-glass rounded-2xl border`: the moment two call sites pick
different radii the product is inconsistent for a reason no diff shows.

Two rules that outrank convenience:

- **Identity lives in the hero, never in the form.** Title, description, icon
  and enabled state are the shell's; a form field for any of them is a second
  place to edit the same thing.
- **The save bar is always the morph.** Controls start in the hero and a fixed
  bar fades in as the hero scrolls away, so nothing is duplicated on screen and
  the bar appears exactly when the title leaves. Never a hand-rolled
  `<div className="sticky …">`, and never a permanently visible bar.
  - `BentoEntityShell` gives you this for free.
  - Every own-hero form uses `BentoFormHero`. Do not compose a fade-out control
    group and a `BentoScrollSaveBar` yourself: they are two halves that drift.
  - A page that saves **imperatively** passes its own buttons through
    `BentoFormHero`'s `actions`, which replaces the default pair in *both*
    copies and keeps the morph.
  - Keep the **destructive** action in the hero's `trailing` only. A controlled
    dialog rendered twice opens two modals at once, and an action inside the
    fade-out group vanishes as the reader scrolls.

## 2. What the package will not hold

The layer is chrome; the map of your product is yours. Four things arrive as
props, and the package has no default for any of them:

| You supply | To |
|---|---|
| The nav array, already filtered by privilege or licence | `BentoNavRail`, `BentoCommandPalette` |
| Routes for account, sign-out and any tenancy surfaces | `BentoUserMenu` |
| A resolved layout and callbacks to persist it | `BentoListPage` |
| A keyword suggester, if you want one | `IconPickerDialog` |

`BentoNavItem` is the render contract, deliberately narrower than what you will
keep: carry `privilege`, licence flags and anything else on your own type, and
pass the filtered result.

An entry appears when its route does. That is how you say a reader may see
something — the package cannot read your feature model, and should not try.

## 3. Colour — a tone is a token

No component in the layer names a colour. A tone is
`--vg-bento-tone-<name>-from` / `-to` in the preset, and the chip reads them, so
you re-key the palette by redefining variables rather than forking a component.
The status intents (`on`, `warn`, `error`, `danger`) work the same way.

Accents — a focus border, the rail's active marker, a hover ring — take your
`--primary`. A shared component marking "you are here" in a colour of its own is
the clearest way to make one product look wrong.

**Claim `--primary`, or four surfaces stay neutral.** The rail's active marker is
not the only thing reading it: `.bento-tile:hover` takes its glow from
`--primary`, `.bento-editing` and `.bento-new-tile` take their borders, and the
default `Button` variant is `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. The preset's
value is a neutral rather than a brand, so keying only the accent leaves all four
near-black on light and near-white on dark — which is what "you are here" looks
like in a product that thinks it has re-keyed.

Claim it at `:root`, through the inputs, the way the accent is claimed:

```css
:root {
  --vg-primary-base: …;                 /* the mark, on light */
  --vg-primary-base-dark: …;            /* and on dark */
  --vg-primary-foreground-base: …;      /* what the solid fill carries */
  --vg-primary-foreground-base-dark: …;
}
```

**Setting `--vg-primary` itself is the mistake the inputs exist to prevent.** Your
stylesheet imports this package and then declares its own `:root`, so it lands
after the preset's dark block at the same specificity and in no layer. One value
set there wins on *both* grounds, and the dark ground silently gets the light
value. The inputs are read per ground, so you never write a dark block.

The solid fill carries text, so that pair holds 4.5:1 on both grounds (§5). An
accent stop at full chroma usually does not, so this value is often a deeper step
than the one the chip is drawn with.

If you need a one-off tint, set `--bento-tone-from` / `--bento-tone-to` on a
subtree instead of touching the tokens.

## 4. i18n

- Reuse the keys you already have. Do not mint a parallel namespace for a
  surface that already has one: the same entity rendered in two chromes is the
  same entity.
- Always pass a default in the **object** form: `t("key", { defaultValue: "…" })`.
  The string form is ambiguous and test mocks generally do not honour it.
- Add every new key to every locale you ship.

## 5. Accessibility

This is a gate, not advice — the catalogue's stories run under axe on every
push, and a violation fails the build.

- **Icon-only controls** get an `aria-label`. Decorative glyphs get
  `aria-hidden` and convey their meaning through an adjacent `sr-only` span:
  screen readers do not reliably announce `aria-label` on a bare `<svg>`, and
  Testing Library's `getByLabelText` will not match it either.
- **Keyboard**: inline edit is reachable and committable by keyboard, the
  palette is arrow-key and Enter navigable, and active rows carry
  `aria-current="page"` (rail) or `aria-selected` (palette).
- **ARIA values are string literals** — `aria-expanded="true"`,
  `aria-selected={active ? "true" : "false"}`. A bare attribute or a
  `{boolean}` expression is a lint failure.
- **Headings increase by one.** The hero is `h1`, so a section under it is `h2`
  — which is what `BentoFormSection` renders by default. A repeated label, like
  the sticky bar's title, is not a heading at all.
- **Contrast holds at 4.5:1**, including text on a tinted surface. Tinted pills
  need the darker text token in light mode.
- **Reduced motion**: every animation in `bento.css` is turned off under
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`, and a test asserts that every
  animating selector is named in that guard. A new keyframe that is not is a
  failing build, not a review comment.

## 6. Responsive

- The grid is `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-6` with `col-span-2`
  tiles and `row-span-2` for a featured one. **Keep spans in multiples of two**
  so tiles reflow cleanly at every breakpoint — this is what keeps two consoles'
  grids aligned.
- The nav rail is desktop-only. Reserve its gutter with `bento-rail-gutter` on
  whatever wraps the routed page. On mobile, navigation is the header's command
  trigger and the global shortcut; do not add a second always-visible nav that
  eats mobile width.
- There is **no sidebar provider**, and no context between the shell's pieces.
  The console era needs one because its sidebar collapses, remembers and pushes
  content; the rail is fixed, one width, and hidden below `md`.

## 7. Tests

- Every shared component here carries vitest and Testing Library coverage, so a
  regression surfaces once rather than in each console.
- Router-dependent components render inside a `MemoryRouter`.
- Assert on the readable `defaultValue` strings rather than on i18n keys, so a
  test reads like the screen does.
- jsdom implements neither `matchMedia`, `ResizeObserver` nor `scrollIntoView`.
  This package's own setup polyfills all three; a consumer testing these
  components will need the same.

## What this does not cover

Which components are the shared layer and which stay in a product is
[docs/BENTO-BOUNDARY.md](BENTO-BOUNDARY.md).

Every rule above, drawn rather than stated, is [docs/reference/](reference/) — eight
artboards, one per decision. Look there when a sentence here is clear and you still cannot
picture the page it describes.
