## Block A — The gate the design system never had

### §VDS121 The consumer whose declaration has to wait for its bump

VDS77 made `react-hook-form` a required peer, and six of the seven consumers declare it:
shio `^7.87.0`, turing `^7.82.0`, dumont `^7.86.0`, and cloud-frontend, cloud-console
and `@rk/ui` declared during that work. Schools is the one left.

Nothing is broken today, because schools pins `@viglet/viglet-design-system` to an exact
`2026.3.9` rather than a range, the newest release published. It never sees the peer
until somebody bumps it, and pnpm would then auto-install the missing peer rather than
fail — which is the same arrangement working by coincidence that VDS77 existed to
remove.

It was deliberately not declared during VDS77, and the reason is worth carrying. Schools
is adopting a check of its own — `src/dependencies.test.ts` — that fails any dependency
no file imports and that carries no documented reason, and it cross-checks each
documented peer against the *installed* manifest. Schools imports no form, so declaring
`react-hook-form` against the 2026.3.3 it installs would be a dependency nothing imports
and whose stated reason the check could not confirm, because that release still calls it
a dependency.

**So the declaration belongs in the same change as the version bump**, not before it.
Bump schools to the release carrying the peer, add `react-hook-form`, and add its entry
to that test's allowlist naming this package as the peer it is provided for — all three
together, so each one is true when it lands.

Until then schools is the consumer that does not declare it, and this line is what says
so rather than leaving it to be rediscovered.

### §VDS163 The tooltip red, and what a recurrence has to say

One full run turned `tooltip.parity.test.tsx` red on "waits for the delay a provider
above it sets", in the same run that reddened the inline-edit focus test. It has passed
in every full run since — eight of nine — and passes alone every time.

VDS162 explained the inline-edit half: a focus assertion with no wait. This half has no
such explanation. Its assertion is a lower bound on elapsed time measured from before
the pointer moves, and load can only make that number larger, so the red was not the
delay being wrong. What is left is the wait around it — `expect.poll` for the bubble, on
a four-second deadline. For that to expire, the tooltip never opened at all, which means
the hover never reached Radix.

A headless page losing focus would explain both files at once: `activeElement` falls
back to the body, and a pointer no longer over the trigger sends no enter. That is a
candidate, not a finding. Nothing measured it.

So this waits for a recurrence with its output kept. What the next one has to say is
which of the two expired — the poll, or the hover before it — and whether the page still
had focus. Raising the deadline before that is guessing at which number was wrong, and
would only make a stalled run take longer to say the same nothing.

### §VDS186 Reading the other bento consumers

The first `pnpm look:census --write` read Shio only: its dev server was the one running
on this machine, on port 5173 against a local backend. Turing, Dumont and roadkeep-gui
sit in `look-allowance.json` as `measured: null` with that reason, so nothing fails when
their look drifts, and every figure in the round is so far a Shio figure.

The work is operational, not new code. Start each consumer's dev server with its
backend, then run `pnpm look:census --url <id>=<start url> --auth <id>=<user:pass>
--write` with that consumer's bento entry as the start. The walk crawls from there and
reads the router, so nothing about the product needs to be declared first. Commit the
allowance it writes. A consumer that renders `<Routes>` below a splat route only shows
its nested patterns once the walk has reached a page under it. If a reading names a
route by a concrete segment rather than `:param`, the probe's route-table walk in
`scripts/look-census.mjs` missed that router. Fix it there before recording, because an
account name in a route would end up in a committed file.

### §VDS195 The story run stalls

`npm test` on 2026-09-28 ran the three projects for 35 minutes with no output and was
stopped. Run alone, the unit and parity projects finished in seconds. The stories
project was run twice with a 1500 s timeout. Both runs used the whole of it, while
vitest measured 34 to 64 s of tests. In each run one file lost its browser (`Browser
connection was closed while running tests`), a different file each time:
`login.stories.tsx`, then `bento-shell.stories.tsx`. The first run also had four files
that never reached the server (`Cannot connect to the server in 60 seconds`). Both files
pass alone in under four seconds.

So the gate is not red on a story. It never finishes, which means nobody can run `npm
test` as the one command the project's instructions list. Start by reading where the
wall clock goes: `--reporter=verbose` with timestamps, and the Storybook cache under
`node_modules/.cache/storybook`, which every run rebuilds its pre-bundle into. Then
check whether the stall follows the worker count. The stories project has no
`maxWorkers` or `fileParallelism` setting, and two browser projects run side by side
under the root `npm test`. A setting that fixes it belongs in `vitest.config.ts` beside
the project it bounds, with the measurement in its comment.

## Block F — What a consuming CMS needs from the package next

### §VDS152 The deprecation ends

BentoActionsMenuItem.id shipped optional, with a warning outside production for an item
that has none, so a product that upgrades is told before it breaks. The deprecation only
means something if it ends: until the field is required, a new action without a name
type-checks, renders and escapes every census that reads data-action-id.

Once one release has carried the warning, make id required on BentoActionsMenuItem,
which BentoEntityShell's extraActions and the data table's row actions already pass
through, and delete warnWithoutId and its test. The change note in the ledger names the
release that warned. Before shipping, run viglet-ds-check-duplicates and a type-check in
each declared consumer's checkout, or read their source, and list any menu still built
without ids, so the breaking release is not the first they hear of it.

## Block C — One look across products

### §VDS182 A quieter surface: the chip for identity, tones for state

The layer's surfaces carry a lot of ornament at once. Frosted glass sits behind every
panel. A 34 to 48 px chip with a blue-to-indigo gradient appears on every tile and every
hero. Each product area gets its own tone, so a Shio console shows blue sites, green
users and violet groups, and the first tile of a list gets a double-size cell with a
radial glow. Each piece is reasonable alone. Together they are why a working screen
reads as a collage: colour appears everywhere and means nothing, so the one colour that
should mean something (the primary action, the current place, a state) has to shout over
it. The proposal keeps the layer's shapes and quiets its surface. The gradient chip
stays on identity only: the entity hero and a hub's tiles, where it names a thing. Rows,
list pages and form sections lose it. Tones stop being a per-area decoration and become
state: published, draft, scheduled, changed since publish and archived, drawn through
`BentoStatusMarker` as a dot and a word. The accent is reserved for the primary action
and "you are here". The emphasised double tile stops being automatic. The hero title
steps down to a size that leaves the fold to the work. The reference artboards now draw
it (solid cards, 16 px hero titles, the chip on hero only) and map states to tones:
published emerald, draft slate, scheduled violet, changed amber, archived neutral.
Components follow the review.

## Block E — The assistant every product shares

### §VDS185 The dock rests at the foot of the rail

The authoring contract gives the corner to the shell: the assistant dock is passed as
`dock`, and `BentoBackToTop` stacks above it, so no component pins itself to the
viewport. The ownership is right, but the result is wrong in the one consumer that was
measured. Shio passes its dock through `BentoShell` as the contract asks, and in every
1440 x 900 capture of 2026-09-28 the orb still sits over page content. It covers the
last row action in the trash, a delete button in the post-type table, a revert button in
the review queue, a tile's corner and the editor's preview. The shell owns the corner
but reserves nothing in it, so the column runs underneath. There are two ways out. One
reserves a gutter the height of the dock at the foot of the column on every page, which
costs space on every screen to protect one element. The other moves the dock's resting
place to a slot the shell already reserves, the foot of the rail, where the orb and its
count sit above the user menu. It opens as a popover anchored to the rail, and on a
phone, where there is no rail, it moves to the header's trailing edge. The second is the
proposal, because the rail foot is empty today and costs nothing. The census's overlap
measure is what shows it done in every consumer that mounts a dock.
