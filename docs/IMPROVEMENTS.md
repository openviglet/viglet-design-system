## Block A — The gate the design system never had

### §VDS121 The consumer whose declaration has to wait for its bump

VDS77 made `react-hook-form` a required peer, and six of the seven consumers declare it:
shio `^7.87.0`, turing `^7.82.0`, dumont `^7.86.0`, and cloud-frontend, cloud-console
and `@rk/ui` declared during that work. Schools is the one left.

Nothing is broken today, because schools pins `@viglet/viglet-design-system` to an exact
`2026.3.9` rather than a range, the newest release published. It never sees the peer
until somebody bumps it, and pnpm would then auto-install the missing peer rather than
fail — which is the same arrangement working by coincidence that VDS77 existed to
remove.

It was deliberately not declared during VDS77, and the reason is worth carrying. Schools
is adopting a check of its own — `src/dependencies.test.ts` — that fails any dependency
no file imports and that carries no documented reason, and it cross-checks each
documented peer against the *installed* manifest. Schools imports no form, so declaring
`react-hook-form` against the 2026.3.3 it installs would be a dependency nothing imports
and whose stated reason the check could not confirm, because that release still calls it
a dependency.

**So the declaration belongs in the same change as the version bump**, not before it.
Bump schools to the release carrying the peer, add `react-hook-form`, and add its entry
to that test's allowlist naming this package as the peer it is provided for — all three
together, so each one is true when it lands.

Until then schools is the consumer that does not declare it, and this line is what says
so rather than leaving it to be rediscovered.

### §VDS163 The tooltip red, and what a recurrence has to say

One full run turned `tooltip.parity.test.tsx` red on "waits for the delay a provider
above it sets", in the same run that reddened the inline-edit focus test. It has passed
in every full run since — eight of nine — and passes alone every time.

VDS162 explained the inline-edit half: a focus assertion with no wait. This half has no
such explanation. Its assertion is a lower bound on elapsed time measured from before
the pointer moves, and load can only make that number larger, so the red was not the
delay being wrong. What is left is the wait around it — `expect.poll` for the bubble, on
a four-second deadline. For that to expire, the tooltip never opened at all, which means
the hover never reached Radix.

A headless page losing focus would explain both files at once: `activeElement` falls
back to the body, and a pointer no longer over the trigger sends no enter. That is a
candidate, not a finding. Nothing measured it.

So this waits for a recurrence with its output kept. What the next one has to say is
which of the two expired — the poll, or the hover before it — and whether the page still
had focus. Raising the deadline before that is guessing at which number was wrong, and
would only make a stalled run take longer to say the same nothing.

### §VDS186 Reading the other bento consumers

The first `pnpm look:census --write` read Shio only: its dev server was the one running
on this machine, on port 5173 against a local backend. Turing, Dumont and roadkeep-gui
sit in `look-allowance.json` as `measured: null` with that reason, so nothing fails when
their look drifts, and every figure in the round is so far a Shio figure.

The work is operational, not new code. Start each consumer's dev server with its
backend, then run `pnpm look:census --url <id>=<start url> --auth <id>=<user:pass>
--write` with that consumer's bento entry as the start. The walk crawls from there and
reads the router, so nothing about the product needs to be declared first. Commit the
allowance it writes. A consumer that renders `<Routes>` below a splat route only shows
its nested patterns once the walk has reached a page under it. If a reading names a
route by a concrete segment rather than `:param`, the probe's route-table walk in
`scripts/look-census.mjs` missed that router. Fix it there before recording, because an
account name in a route would end up in a committed file.

### §VDS195 The story run stalls

On 2026-09-28 `npm test` ran for 35 minutes with no output and was stopped. Two later
runs of the stories project alone each used their whole 1500 s timeout while vitest
measured 34 to 64 s of tests. In each, one file lost its browser (`Browser connection
was closed while running tests`), a different file each time: `login.stories.tsx`, then
`bento-shell.stories.tsx`. The first also had four files that never connected (`Cannot
connect to the server in 60 seconds`). Both files pass alone in under four seconds.

The same evening it did not come back. The stories project passed alone in 40 s, and
again in 22 s with `npm run build` running beside it. The whole of `npm test` passed in
62 s. Both stalled runs had a build or a Storybook build beside them, and another
session was driving Chromium against a Shio dev server at the time, so load is the
suspect, but a build alone did not reproduce it.

So the defect worth fixing is narrower than a slow gate: once a page drops, the run
waits out whatever timeout wraps it instead of failing that file. Pick this up with a
reproduction in hand. Then read where the wall clock goes (`--reporter=verbose`,
timestamped), and check whether `browser.connectTimeout`, a bound on the stories
project's workers, or `teardownTimeout` turns the hang into a failure. The setting
belongs in `vitest.config.ts` beside that project, with the measurement in its comment.

## Block F — What a consuming CMS needs from the package next

### §VDS152 The deprecation ends

BentoActionsMenuItem.id shipped optional, with a warning outside production for an item
that has none, so a product that upgrades is told before it breaks. The deprecation only
means something if it ends: until the field is required, a new action without a name
type-checks, renders and escapes every census that reads data-action-id.

Once one release has carried the warning, make id required on BentoActionsMenuItem,
which BentoEntityShell's extraActions and the data table's row actions already pass
through, and delete warnWithoutId and its test. The change note in the ledger names the
release that warned. Before shipping, run viglet-ds-check-duplicates and a type-check in
each declared consumer's checkout, or read their source, and list any menu still built
without ids, so the breaking release is not the first they hear of it.

## Block E — The assistant every product shares

### §VDS185 The dock rests at the foot of the rail

The authoring contract gives the corner to the shell: the assistant dock is passed as
`dock`, and `BentoBackToTop` stacks above it, so no component pins itself to the
viewport. The ownership is right, but the result is wrong in the one consumer that was
measured. Shio passes its dock through `BentoShell` as the contract asks, and in every
1440 x 900 capture of 2026-09-28 the orb still sits over page content. It covers the
last row action in the trash, a delete button in the post-type table, a revert button in
the review queue, a tile's corner and the editor's preview. The shell owns the corner
but reserves nothing in it, so the column runs underneath. There are two ways out. One
reserves a gutter the height of the dock at the foot of the column on every page, which
costs space on every screen to protect one element. The other moves the dock's resting
place to a slot the shell already reserves, the foot of the rail, where the orb and its
count sit above the user menu. It opens as a popover anchored to the rail, and on a
phone, where there is no rail, it moves to the header's trailing edge. The second is the
proposal, because the rail foot is empty today and costs nothing. The census's overlap
measure is what shows it done in every consumer that mounts a dock.

## Block C — One look across products

### §VDS198 A closed radius scale

The radius tokens are arithmetic on one value: --radius-sm, md, lg and xl are
--vg-radius minus 4, minus 2, plus nothing and plus 4, and the bento surfaces add 16 and
24 px of their own. Every consumer that changes --vg-radius moves all four, and any
rounded-[n] in a consumer adds another; Shio's console measured ten distinct radii
(SH1199, section LV.36 in Shio's IMPROVEMENTS). The closed scale is three values: 6 px
for a control (button, input, select, badge, menu item), 10 px for a panel (card, bento
panel, dialog, popover, tile), and full for pills, avatars and the state dot. Declare
them as --vg-radius-control, --vg-radius-panel and --vg-radius-full, re-point the
Tailwind radius keys at them (sm and md to control, lg and xl to panel) so existing
class names keep compiling, and move the bento 16 and 24 px surfaces onto panel. Add a
test that fails when a component in the package resolves a radius outside the three, and
a census reading consumers report the way they report colour. Shio adopts it in SH1199.

### §VDS199 One monospace family

The package declares no monospace family. Tailwind's font-mono falls back to the
browser's stack, floating-formulas-bg.css names JetBrains Mono and Fira Code, and
bento-diff renders its rows in whatever font-mono resolves to, so a consumer gets three
different monos on one screen; Shio's console measured three (SH1199, section LV.36 in
Shio's IMPROVEMENTS). Declare one family as --vg-font-mono in preset.css, map Tailwind's
--font-mono to it, point floating-formulas-bg and bento-diff at the token, and set the
12 px mono step the type scale reserves for ids, paths, keys and diffs. The font file is
not bundled: the stack names the family and falls back to ui-monospace, so a consumer
that does not load it still gets one mono. Add a test that fails when a stylesheet in
the package names a monospace family other than the token, and a census reading of
distinct font families per consumer. Shio adopts it in SH1199.

### §VDS200 Controls still off the height scale

The closed control-height scale in preset.css covers Button, GradientButton, Toggle,
Input, SelectTrigger, SidebarInput and the bento actions trigger, and a browser test
holds each of them to dense or form. Other interactive elements still set a fixed
height. SidebarMenuButton draws h-8, h-7 and h-12 for its three sizes, the
SidebarMenuSub button h-7, the navigation-menu trigger h-9, the bento list page's
reorder grip h-7 and the command palette's search field h-12. Each one is a height a
look census counts. Decide per element whether it is a control on the scale (the grip
and the sidebar's sm and default rows are dense, the navigation trigger is form) or a
row that is not a control at all (sidebar lg, the palette field), move the controls onto
the tokens, and add the controls to the CONTROLS table in
control-height.parity.test.tsx. A row left off the scale says why in a comment beside
its class.
