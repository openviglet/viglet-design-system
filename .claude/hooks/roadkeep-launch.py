"""The launcher for an environment the plugin never reaches (RK1108).

Why this file exists
--------------------
roadkeep ships as a Claude Code *plugin*, and on a developer machine that is the whole
install: `/plugin install` places it under the harness's config directory and its
``hooks/hooks.json`` registers the guard that denies a hand-edit of the governed files.
There is one environment where none of that happens. **Claude Code on the web has no
``/plugin`` command and installs no marketplace plugin** — it reads settings and files
committed to the repository. So the hooks and the MCP server never load, the guard is
absent, and an agent falls back to editing ROADMAP.md by hand: the drift this tool exists
to stop, in the environment with the least supervision.

This file is committed to the adopting repository, which that environment *does* read.
``roadkeep install --committed`` writes it to ``.claude/hooks/`` and points the hook and
the server at it, so the write path is enforced wherever a session runs.

It is deliberately standalone — it runs *before* an engine has been found, so it may not
import :mod:`roadkeep`. That makes it the one file here that restates a rule stated in the
package, and `tests/test_launching.py` holds the two together: :func:`_config_home` is
:func:`roadkeep.provenance.installed`'s first two lines, and a closure test fails when
either moves. A second implementation nobody checks is how the version this replaced came
to look under ``~/.claude`` alone (see below).

The engine is resolved in this order:

  1. ``$ROADKEEP_HOME/scripts/roadkeep.py``          an explicit override, and where it is
                                                      set the only one (RK1678)
  2. a vendored ``.roadkeep/``                        the copy the project chose (RK1193)
  3. a sibling checkout ``../roadkeep``              two repositories cloned side by side
  4. a cached clone under the user cache directory   the web, second turn onward

The last three are *found*, so the first of them that runs answers. The first is *named*, so
nothing else answers for it: a copy nobody chose, answering where the named one could not, is
indistinguishable from the named one answering (see :func:`_candidates`).

Three rules keep it from ever making things worse, and the first is the **guard's alone**:

  * **Defer to the plugin.** Where the harness has roadkeep enabled *for this project*, its
    own hook already runs, so ``guard`` here becomes a silent no-op and no deny message is
    doubled. That question is a row in the harness's registry and **never a file on disk**: this is
    the defect the shipped version exists to fix. A hand-written copy globbed
    ``~/.claude/plugins`` for ``scripts/roadkeep.py``, which finds a marketplace clone and
    every cached version whether or not the project uses any of them — so under a
    ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` pointing elsewhere it stood down in favour of a plugin that was
    never loaded, and a hand edit of two governed files passed a session with a guard.
  * **Never block a turn.** If no engine is found, every mode exits 0 and emits nothing. A
    missing roadkeep must degrade to "unenforced", never to a broken session.
  * **Never reach the network.** The cache is used where something else populated it; this
    file does not clone. A hook that fetches code is a hook that runs code the repository
    did not commit, and the environment this exists for is the one that reviews it least.

``mcp`` keeps **neither of the first two**, and standing down there was the defect this was
reported from (RK1189). A stdio server has no way to say *another copy answers*: it either
speaks the protocol on the stdin the harness handed it or it exits, and an exit **is** how a
server reports a crash — so the deferral rendered the project's own declared server ``✗
failed`` in the harness's listing, in exactly the projects where everything was installed
correctly. Measured in Shio, where that is worse than cosmetic: the plugin's server and the
project's are both named ``roadkeep``, so the failed entry took the name and the session had
no roadkeep tools at all. ``install`` writes both declarations deliberately — the harness
reads them separately and only the hooks would fire twice (`installing.plan`) — so the file
it writes has to **serve wherever it is started**, and a missing engine is a refusal on
stderr for the reason a forwarded verb's is.

The engine invoked is ``scripts/roadkeep.py`` — roadkeep's own launcher, which puts its
``src`` on ``sys.path`` and calls ``roadkeep.cli.main``. So the arguments, exit codes and
refusals are that engine's own; this file only decides *which copy answers*.

Anything that is **not** one of those two modes is forwarded to that engine (RK1116). Both
modes are internal — the harness calls ``guard`` from a hook and ``mcp`` from ``.mcp.json`` —
so a file that answered only them resolved an engine for the two callers that are not the
agent and refused the one that was handed its name: the installed skill states ``python
".claude/hooks/roadkeep-launch.py"`` as the project's entry point and then describes commands,
and every one of them exited 2 on a usage line naming ``guard`` and ``mcp``. Where the MCP
server connected, the tools cover it; where it did not, the session had a working engine on
disk, a documented way to reach it, and no verb that arrived — so the fallback was guessing at
a checkout path, which is the guess this file exists to remove.

A forwarded verb keeps the resolution order and **neither of the first two rules** — the pair
``mcp`` keeps neither of, and for the same reason — because both are about the one caller that
did not ask, which is the hook that fires on every turn:

  * the plugin is not deferred to — a command somebody typed is answered whether or not some
    other surface could also have answered it, and silence is not an answer to ``pick``;
  * a missing engine is a **refusal** and not a quiet 0 — "unenforced beats broken" is the
    right trade for a hook that fires on every turn and the wrong one for a command whose
    exit code is read as its result.

    call tools it had never been handed and a hand-edit was denied with a command it could not

    in silence is indistinguishable from one that started and closed cleanly.

    extra process in the chain, and still no pipe in the middle, which is the property the
